# Weather Core API 

## General Rules:
1. `git pull` or `git pull origin main` before working on any ticket on the Task Board
2. `git checkout <your_branch>` or `git checkout -b <your_branch>` to work on each feature.
3. branch naming: `feature/feature_name`
4. when development for a ticket is done, submit a PR to `main` branch and wait for at least 1 person to review.
5. A pipeline will be created for this repo to auto-build and potentially check for code coverage. For now, any changes will be reviewed for building locally successfully.
6. Test pipeline 123.
